Hi, I'm Tanmay. I'm a **Data Scientist** at **[Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/)**, where I'm a part of the [Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning (AAML) Group](https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-models-at-scale-with-ai-ml-01612382528) and am focusing on building machine learning models for fraud detection. Prior to this, I studied **Information Science** at **Cornell University**, where I focused my coursework around [data science](https://infosci.cornell.edu/research/data-science) and [behavioral science](https://cals.cornell.edu/news/tanmay-bansal-21-studying-behavioral-science-interventions). I'm currently based in **New York**.

I've explored different domains and roles over the years, but at the core, I really enjoy using data and logic to solve business problems. I'm always happy to chat - drop me a line!
